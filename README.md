No tricks here, just a tool to gain knowledge from the web.

A web scrapper/crawler named after a spider from stories I was told as a kid.

## ⚠️ Project Status ⚠️

The goal of this project is to build a Web Scrapper. Part of the goal of this project is learn more about how web browsers work. This means the project will included an HTML, CSS parser and a JavaScript interpretor over time.

- [ ] parsing the HTML from my [website](https://zaneenders.com).
- [ ] parse and interpret enough JavaScript for [HTMX](https://htmx.org) to update the DOM.
